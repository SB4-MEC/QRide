The project aims to revolutionize the public transportation experience through the development of a comprehensive web
application â€œQR-Code Enabled Bus Stop Information System".The system leverages QR code technology at bus stops, allowing commuters to access information about bus timings,
arrivals, destinations, and fare estimates simply by scanning QR
codes with their smartphones. This user-friendly platform provides
personalized features. It not only benefits users by making their
journeys efficient and predictable but also empowers bus owners
with increased visibility, operational efficiency, and the ability to
optimize services based on data-driven insights, ultimately
improving the overall quality and sustainability of public
transportation systems.
